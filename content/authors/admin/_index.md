Hi! I am currently a graduate student studing data science at New York University! Before this, I obtained B.S. in Informatics (Data Science concentration) at the University of Washington. My research interests:

 (1) Unraveling the intricate links between data and human health to better understand and address health disparities

 (2) Developing interpretable NLP models for information extraction from health-related text

 (3) Designing human-in-the-loop AI systems that support healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers in making evidence-based decisions.

 Please see my research expereience in my resume!
