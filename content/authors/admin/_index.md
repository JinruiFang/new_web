Hi! I am currently a graduate student studing data science at New York University! Before this, I obtained B.S. in Informatics (Data Science concentration) at the University of Washington. My research interests are (1) unraveling the intricate links between data and human health to better understand and address health disparities, (2) developing interpretable NLP models for information extraction from health-related text, and (3) designing human-in-the-loop AI systems that support healthcare providers, patients, and policymakers in making evidence-based decisions.
